        You can write custom asserts by providing extension function. 
        All asserts and navigation methods implemented via extension function 
        to the `Checkable` and `Explorable` interfaces.
        To add new one simply write your own extension functions to these interfaces 
        and follow convention of default onces.
        Maybe your asserts is worth to be added to default asserts list into KBDD project. 
        Pull Requests are welcome!

        To simplify assertion logic string values in response can be automatically cast to numbers. 
        Casting relay on asserting method argument. 
        If you compare value from response with number, and value in response is a string, 
        but can be casted to number. Then KBDD will try to automatically cast string value 
        to a numeric type of the argument.
        Test demonstratest difference in comparing string with string and 
        comparing string with numbers with auto-cast in action.
