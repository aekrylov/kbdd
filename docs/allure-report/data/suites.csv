        You can write custom asserts by providing extension function. 
        If you do so, maybe your asserts is worth to be added to main asserts list into KBDD project. 
        Pull Requests are welcome!

        Asserts for floating point numbers looks the same as for integers. 
        Be aware that you can not simply check two floating point numbers for equality 
        and should always provide delta that sets value comparison error limit.

        To simplify assertion logic string values in response can be automatically cast to numbers. 
        Casting relay on asserting method argument. 
        If you compare value from response with number, and value in response is a string, 
        but can be casted to number. Then KBDD will try to automatically cast string value 
        to a numeric type of the argument.
        Test demonstratest difference in comparing string with string and 
        comparing string with numbers with auto-cast in action.
